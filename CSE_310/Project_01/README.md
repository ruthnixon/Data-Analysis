# Overview
As a software engineer, I wanted to combine my knowledge of python and sql. I also wanted to get more experience working with a database. 

# Purpose of my Program

My program allows the user to enter, delete, lookup, and modify a database. The user selects from a list of options and enters in data different kind of data depending on the sql command they are running.

# Relational Database

The database represents a database of an online ordering company. There are three tables in this database. These tables are customer table, product table, and an order table. The order table contains data from both customer and product table. 

# Development Environment

I used python along with the python libraries, sqlite3, and datatime.

# Future Work

* I would like to allow the user insert new customers to the customer table and products to the product table. 
* I would also like to implement more tables in the future.
