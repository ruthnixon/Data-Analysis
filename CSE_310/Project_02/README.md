# Overview

This project aims to answer the various questions that came to me after looking over the astronauts dataset. I am hoping to get more experience analyzing data.  

# The Data I found

I am using a dataset of NASA Astronauts from the year 1959 to the present time. The dataset consists of data such as astronauts birthdays, the year they joined NASA, gender, and what majors they studied among other data as well. 
The link for the dataset is: https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/astronaut-yearbook

# Purpose of my Software 

My software queries the data and looks at sections that provide insight for some of the questions I had after looking over the dataset. I also created tables that provide a visual for a better analysis.

# Data Analysis Questions and Results

* My first question is: Which astronauts had the highest spaceflight to spaceflight hours ratio?

It seems like males have the highest spaceflight ratio. 

* My second question is: what years had the most female and male astronauts?

1996 is the year that most female astronauts joined NASA and 1978 is the year that most male astronauts joined NASA. 

* My third question is: what are the average spacewalk hours for all the female and male astronauts?

The average spacewalk for all female astronauts is 4.4 and the average spacewalk for all the male astronauts is 8.24. 

* My fourth question is: what major is best to become an astronaut?

It seems like physics is the best major to become astronaut. Most astronauts studied physics for their undergrad. 

# Development Environment

I used the python library pandas for this project. I did my code in a jupytr  notebook which programs in python.

# Future Work

* I would like to ask more questions to further explore the dataset and gain more insight.
* In the future, I would also like to explore a larger dataset.
